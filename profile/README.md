# ChatCoin Protocol

**ChatCoin** is a decentralized, agent-based platform where profiles act as programmable containers for identity, apps, wallets, social graphs, and autonomous AI agents. Built for the next evolution of the internet, ChatCoin combines zero-knowledge privacy, modular execution, and ethical AI governance into a unified programmable environment.
